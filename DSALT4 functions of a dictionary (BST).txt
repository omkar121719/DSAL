Problem Statement:
A dictionary stores keywords and its meaning...... use bst
Objectives:
1. Understand the concept of ADT functions
2. Understand the concept of Hashing
3. Understand the concept of chaining with / without replacement
Outcomes:
1. Will be able to use BST
Software Requirements:
1. 64-bit Open source Linux or its derivative
2. Open Source C++ Programming tool like G++/GCC.
3. Dev C++ compiler
Theory:-
BST- A bst is a binary tree,which is easier empty or in which each node contains a key that satisfies the following condition:
	1.All keys are distinct
	2.For every node x, in the tree, the values of all the keys in its left subtree are smaller than the key value in x
	3.All keys in its right subtree are larger than the key value in x.
Deletion operation in bst- In order to delete a node, we must find the node to be deleted may be:
	1.A leaf node
	2.A node with one child
	3.A node with two child
(Draw diagrams)
Conclusion: Thus we have implemented hashing and collision handling technique linear
